# declarations

The "declarations" folder is used to contain TypeScript declaration files or other types of declarations.

Declarations are used to define types for external libraries or frameworks that are not written in TypeScript, but are used in the application. For example, if a JavaScript library such as jQuery is used, a type declaration file can be created for jQuery so that the TypeScript compiler can check the types of jQuery used in the application.

In addition, it reduces the possibility of errors and simplifies the development of applications written in TypeScript, making the code easier to maintain and modify in the future.
