# theme

"The theme folder is used to contain configuration files for defining the style of the application's user interface, and its usage can simplify the management of the application's style, facilitate updating the visual appearance, and improve the consistency and usability of the user interface. Additionally, it can make the code easier to read and understand, especially for developers working on the project in the future."
