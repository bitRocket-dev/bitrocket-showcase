# constants

The "constants" folder is used to contain constants that are used in different parts of the application.

In this folder, it is possible to create files with constant variables such as:

API service URLs
Configuration constants such as maximum character limit in an input
Style constants such as predefined colors or text sizes
These constants can be imported into different parts of the application, such as components or utility files. This way, if a constant changes, it will only need to be modified in one place instead of searching and modifying all instances of the constant throughout the application.
