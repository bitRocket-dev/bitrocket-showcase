# redux-modules

"The redux-modules folder is used to contain Redux modules that define the state of the application and the actions to modify it, such as modules for managing the shopping cart, modules for managing the language of the application, and so on. Its usage can simplify the development of Redux applications, improve code maintainability, and facilitate debugging. Additionally, it can make the code easier to read and understand, especially for developers working on the project in the future."
